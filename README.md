- [Re-branding with the American Red Cross](https://github.com/tvasil/visualizations/tree/master/SWD_june2019_rebranding)
  - Exercise made in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tania.vasilikioti#!/vizhome/RedCrossSWDChallenge/RedCrossdashboard-SWDJune2019) with **fake data**, aiming to recreate a data visualization with a specific brand's feel. I chose the American Red Cross for their iconic use of red color to drive relief support. 
- [Recreate Economist plot](https://github.com/tvasil/visualizations/tree/master/economist_hdi_corruption): Exercise done in the IE Data Science Bootcamp, inspired from the Harvard ggplot2 workshop called [R graphics with ggplot2 workshop notes](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html)
